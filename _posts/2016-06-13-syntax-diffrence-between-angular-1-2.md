With Angular2, there are a lot of things which are going to change and we must have to adopt that.
so when we look at the Angular2, the implementaion of the framework itself has changed with the improved scripting language Typescript and in order to see the approch of the development, angular team has made the other necessary changes as well. Let's have a look at the syntax changes that has been released in beta version of Angular2.

In Angular1, we have a semantic syntax (ng-) for all directives, events, template syntax, etc. But here in Angular2, we will be having different syntax for directives, events, template syntax to identify them and understand the use of it appropriately.

Here is your guide to the syntax of Angular1.x & Angular2
