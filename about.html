## About

I'm a Front end developer from Gujarat, India. I'm a perfect mix, of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, AngularJS and learning Typescript to Enjoy the future web. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple. If I weren’t a front-end developer, I’d want to be a chef. I have experience of working with various kinds of teams at onshore and offshore. I have been to London, United Kingdom for a year as a Front-end developer.
